# Layoff_Analysis
In this Project, I carried out an Exploratory Data Analysis on Layoffs between 2020 and 2022. With this, I discovered amongst others that layoff activities in 2022 have so far surpassed the peak reached in 2020, when the COVID-19 Pandemic forced millions of companies to shut down. The following Questions were answered through the analysis of the data:
1. Number of Layoffs over the years (2020-2022)
2. Layoffs by Month
3. Top 10 Companies by number of layoffs in 2020
4. Top 10 Companies by number of layoffs in 2021
5. Top 10 Companies by number of layoffs in 2022
6. Top 20 Countries by number of layoffs
7. Top 20 Companies by number of layoffs
8. Industries by number of layoffs
9. Layoffs by Stage
10. Average layoffs by Year
11. Average layoffs by Month
12. Average layoffs by Industry
13. Average layoffs by Stage
